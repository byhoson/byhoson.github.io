## Personal
* I spent most of my life in [Mapo, Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapo_District).
  Other than that, I have lived in Xiamen(China), Daejeon(Korea), and Pohang(Korea).
* How to pronounce my name: just put the 'B' sound in front of 'young'!
* One of my few hobbies is learning languages, although not active most of the time.
  Besides Korean and English, I repeat resuming & quitting learning French, German and Russian.
* Other than that, I listen to music and watch films. Some of the best experiences I've ever had:
  - **Pink Floyd** / **Radiohead** / Tame Impala / Suede / Kino
  - All of **Bossa Nova** music by Joao Gilberto & Tom Jobim
  - Vertigo (Hitchcock) / In the Mood for Love (Wong Kar-Wai)
