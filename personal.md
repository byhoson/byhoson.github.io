## Personal
* I spent most of my life in [Mapo, Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapo_District).
  Other than that, I have lived in Xiamen(China), Daejeon(Korea), and Pohang(Korea).
* How to pronounce my name: just put the 'B' sound in front of 'young'!
* I enjoy language learning, although not active most of the time.
  Besides Korean and English, I tried learning French, Mandarin Chinese, German and Russian.

  - **Pink Floyd** / **Radiohead** / Tame Impala / Suede / Kino (Viktor Tsoi)
  - All of **Bossa Nova** music by Joao Gilberto & Tom Jobim
