## Personal
* [MagicSquare](/asset/magic_square.html/): A simple html game that I designed myself during my high school days.
  Probably my first coding experience ever with > 100 lines of code
* I spent most of my life in [Mapo, Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapo_District).
  Other than that, I have lived in Xiamen, Daejeon, and Pohang.
* How to pronounce my name: just put the 'B' sound in front of 'young'!
* I speak Korean and English. I forgot how to speak Mandarin. I was working on my French.
* I enjoy music and films from time to time. Here are some of my all-time favorites:
  - Radiohead / Tame Impala / Pink Floyd / Suede / Kino
  - Joao Gilberto / Antonio Carlos Jobim
  - Alfred Hitchcock / Wong Kar-Wai
