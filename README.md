Hello, there!
I am a 2nd year Ph.D candidate at POSTECH. 
I study formal methods at Software Verification Lab, advised by Kyungmin Bae.
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Sogang University.
I try to get my hands dirty by the sins of real-world systems,
with my eyes wide open at the scenes of computational horizons,
while sniffing my nose around for the scent of abstract nonsense.

## Research Interest
I am interested in compromising beautiful reasoning principles for computational reality.

### Logic & Semantics
* Logical Frameworks to formally modeling and specifying concurrent systems, programming languages, etc.
  With a particular focus on [Rewriting Logic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567832612000707),
  among many others (e.g. process algebra, coalgebraic methods, etc).
* I am also interested in deep foundational connections between logic and computation in the following sense;
[BÃ¼chi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot_theorem),
[Fagin's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin%27s_theorem),
[Courcell's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem),
[Curry-Howard Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence).

### Formal Methods
* Scalable model checking techniques; e.g. abstraction, heuristics, etc. 
* Program analysis. See [CCS22](/#publication).

### Security & Privacy
* cryptographic protocol analysis
* distributed systems

## Education
* (2022 Aug - present) Ph.D. Student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr). POSTECH. 
  (advisor: [*Kyungmin Bae*](http://sv.postech.ac.kr/~kmbae))
* (2018 Feb - 2022 Aug)
  B.E. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.sogang.ac.kr/cs/index_new.html) 
  & B.S. in [Mathematics](https://math.sogang.ac.kr/math/index_new.html) (Double Major). 
  Sogang University. *Magna Cum Laude*

## Experience
* (2022 Aug - present) Research Assistant. [Software Verification Lab](http://sv.postech.ac.kr). 
  POSTECH. (Advisor: [*Kyungmin Bae*](http://sv.postech.ac.kr/~kmbae))
* (2021 Jul - 2022 Jan) Undergraduate Research Intern. [ProsysLab](https://prosys.kaist.ac.kr). 
  KAIST. (Advisor: [*Kihong Heo*](https://kihongheo.kaist.ac.kr))

## Project
Some codes I've ever written or assisted writing so far..
* [Tracer](https://prosys.kaist.ac.kr/tracer): A similarty-based alarm ranking system on top of [Infer](https://fbinfer.com/).
  This filters out a tremendous amount of false alarms raised by static analysis alone, via known vulnerability traces in the database.

* [TakeThis](http://cscp2.sogang.ac.kr/CSE4187/index.php/TakeThis): A university course recommendation system,
  using language-model based keyword extractor.
  Undergrad Capstone Project @ Sogang University.

## Personal (tmi)
* [MagicSquare](/_pages/magic_square.html/): A simple html game that I designed myself during my high school days.
  Probably my first coding experience ever with > 100 lines of code
* I spent most of my life in [Mapo, Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapo_District).
  Other than that, I have lived in Xiamen, Daejeon, Pohang.
* How to pronounce my name: just put the 'B' sound in front of 'young'!
* I speak Korean and English. I forgot how to speak Mandarin. I was working on my French.
* I enjoy music and films from time to time. Here are some of my all-time favorites:
  - Radiohead / Tame Impala / Pink Floyd / Suede / Nirvana
  - Joao Gilberto / Antonio Carlos Jobim
  - Alfred Hitchcock / Wong Kar-Wai
