Hello, there!
I am a Ph.D student at POSTECH. 
I study formal methods at Software Verification Lab, advised by Kyungmin Bae.
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Sogang University.
Here is my [CV](/asset/cv.pdf).

I am interested in compromising and exploiting logical reasoning principles to combat computational obstacles,
aiming at providing provable guarantees for realistic software systems.

## Research Interest
I am currently working on formal methods area. In particular,
* Formal Verification
> Fighting state-space explosion problem rised in model checking, by abstraction and heuristics
* Logic
> Reasoning & specifying concurrent, distributed systems based on Rewriting Logic

I am also interested in applying formal methods to closely related areas, such as
Programming Laguages, Software Engineering, Security & Privacy, Concurrency, Distributed Systems, etc.
